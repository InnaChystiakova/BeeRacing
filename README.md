### Features DONE

✅ Start screen with Race button
✅ Bee Racing list
✅ Show and process captcha
✅ Error handling

### Improvements to done
🔧 Error screnn instead of alert
🔧 Bee list inteface (medal for 1st, 2d, 3d places, images for bee avatars, etc)
🔧 Winner screen
🔧 Class documentation comments

### Problems I faced
❌ Dismiss Captcha WebView properly to decrease memory usage and re-create bee race
(I didn't understand which request has to be listened to perorm captcha undo)
❌ Show timer counter on the bee race screen
(I didn't understand completely the requirements for this header, so there is just a sceleton in BRTimerView class)
