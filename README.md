### Features DONE  

✅ Start screen with Race button  
✅ Bee Racing list  
✅ Show and process captcha  
✅ Error handling  

### Improvements to done  
🔧 Error screnn instead of alert  
🔧 Bee list inteface (medal for 1st, 2d, 3d places, images for bee avatars, etc)  
🔧 Winner screen  
🔧 Class documentation comments  

### Problems I faced  
❌ Dismiss Captcha WebView properly to decrease memory usage and re-create bee race  
(I didn't understand which request has to be listened to perform captcha undo)  
❌ Show timer counter on the bee race screen  
(I didn't understand completely the requirements for this header, so there is just a sceleton in BRTimerView class)  

### P.S
🙏 I'm sorry for the last commit in main.  
I wanted to do all my best for this task at this complicated time.  
This is a fascinating task that you can't tear yourself away from.
